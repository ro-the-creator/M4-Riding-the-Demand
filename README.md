### Stakeholders

</div>

- **Product Manager (PM):** When/where demand is strong or fragile; user behavior patterns; which hypotheses to prioritize next quarter.
  
- **Operations Lead:** Inventory rebalancing windows; staffing for spikes; low-impact maintenance windows.

- **Marketing Lead:** Promo timing (day/hour/season), and segments likely to respond (e.g., casual rider vs registered).

- **Policy & Ethics Advisor:** Equity of access; avoiding decisions that disadvantage specific times/areas; responsible communication of uncertainty.
